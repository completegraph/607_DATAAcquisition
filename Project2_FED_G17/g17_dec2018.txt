                                 FEDERAL RESERVE STATISTICAL RELEASE                                 
 
 G.17 (419)                                                          For release at 9:15 a.m. (EST)
                                                                     December 14, 2018

 Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization

 
       Industrial production rose 0.6 percent in November after moving down 0.2 percent in October; the
 index for October was previously reported to have edged up 0.1 percent.  In November, manufacturing
 production was unchanged, the output of mining increased 1.7 percent, and the index for utilities gained
 3.3 percent.  At 109.4 percent of its 2012 average, total industrial production was 3.9 percent higher in
 November than it was a year earlier.  Capacity utilization for the industrial sector rose 0.4 percentage
 point in November to 78.5 percent, a rate that is 1.3 percentage points below its long-run (1972-2017)
 average.
 
 Market Groups
 -------------
 
       The major market groups posted mixed results in November.  The index for consumer goods edged up,
 as a rise of nearly 2 percent for consumer energy products was mostly offset by a loss of 1/2 percent for
 non-energy nondurables.  The index for business equipment moved down about 1/4 percent, and the index for
 defense and space equipment was unchanged.
 
       Among nonindustrial supplies, the output of construction supplies declined nearly 1/4 percent in
 November, while the index for business supplies rose 1/2 percent.  The output of industrial materials
 moved up more than 1 percent, with gains in durables, in nondurables, and in energy materials.
 
 Industry Groups
 ---------------
 
       Manufacturing output was unchanged in November, as an increase of 0.2 percent for durable
 manufacturing was offset by decreases of 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent for nondurable manufacturing and
 other manufacturing (publishing and logging), respectively.  Within durable manufacturing, primary metals
 posted a gain of nearly 2-1/2 percent; no other major industry group recorded a gain of more than 1/2
 percent and several recorded losses.  Among nondurables, most major categories posted declines.
 
       Mining output advanced 1.7 percent in November, with gains in oil and gas extraction, coal mining,
 and support activities for mining; the index for mining was 13.2 percent above its level of a year
 earlier.  The output of utilities rose 3.3 percent in November, with increases for both electric and gas
 utilities; natural gas distribution rose sharply in both October and November, as unseasonably cold
 weather supported demand for heating.
 
       Capacity utilization for manufacturing edged down in November to 75.7 percent, about 2-1/2
 percentage points below its long-run average, as a slight rise for durables was outweighed by declines for
 nondurables and other manufacturing (publishing and logging).  The utilization rate for mining increased
 to 94.1 percent and remained well above its long-run average of 87.0 percent.  The operating rate for
 utilities moved up to 79.4 percent, a rate that is about 6 percentage points below its long-run average.
 

 Notice

 Revision of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization
 
       The Federal Reserve Board plans to issue its annual revision to the index of industrial production
 (IP) and the related measures of capacity utilization around the end of the first quarter of 2019.  The
 Economic Census for 2017 will not be available from the U.S. Census Bureau by early 2019, so no new annual
 benchmark data will be included for manufacturing.  Other annual data, including information on the mining
 of metallic and nonmetallic minerals (except fuels), will be incorporated.  The updated IP indexes will
 include revisions to the monthly indicator (either product data or input data) and to seasonal factors for
 each industry.  In addition, the estimation methods for some series may be changed.  Any modifications to
 the methods for estimating the output of an industry will affect the index from 1972 to the present.
 
       Capacity and capacity utilization will be revised to incorporate data through the fourth quarter
 of 2018 from the U.S. Census Bureau's Quarterly Survey of Plant Capacity Utilization along with new data
 on capacity from the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Department of Energy, and other organizations.

 r  Revised.  p  Preliminary.
 Note.  The statistics in this release cover output, capacity, and capacity utilization in the
 U.S. industrial sector, which is defined by the Federal Reserve to comprise manufacturing,
 mining, and electric and gas utilities. Mining is defined as all industries in sector 21 of the
 North American Industry Classification System (NAICS); electric and gas utilities are those in
 NAICS sectors 2211 and 2212. Manufacturing comprises NAICS manufacturing industries (sector 31-33)
 plus the logging industry and the newspaper, periodical, book, and directory publishing industries.
 Logging and publishing are classified elsewhere in NAICS (under agriculture and information
 respectively), but historically they were considered to be manufacturing and were included in
 the industrial sector under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system.  In December 2002
 the Federal Reserve reclassified all its industrial output data from the SIC system to NAICS.

 The reliability measures show the likely range of values for the IP indexes after their fifth and final monthly
 revision.  The 15th (85th) percentile estimate is equal to the current estimate plus an amount such that the
 equivalent measure revised by a lower (higher) amount for only 15 percent of the months since 2008.  More
 information is available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/g17_technical_qa.htm
 
 
 
 
 Explanatory Note

 
 The Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization statistical release,
 which is published around the middle of the month, reports measures of
 output, capacity, and capacity utilization in manufacturing, mining, and
 the electric and gas utilities industries.  More detailed descriptions of
 industrial production and capacity utilization are available on the Board's
 website at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17. In addition, files
 containing data shown in the release, more detailed series
 that were published in the G.17 prior to December 2000, and
 historical data are available from the Data Download Program on the Board's website.
 Instructions for searching for and downloading specific series are provided as well.
  
 Industrial Production
 
 Coverage. The industrial production (IP) index measures the real
 output of the manufacturing, mining, and electric and gas utilities
 industries; the reference period for the index is 2012.
 Manufacturing consists of those industries included in the North American Industry
 Classification System, or NAICS, definition of manufacturing plus
 those industries- logging and newspaper, periodical, book, and directory
 publishing-that have traditionally been considered to
 be manufacturing and included in the industrial sector.
 For the period since 1997, the total IP index has
 been constructed from 300 individual series based on the 2012 NAICS
 codes. These individual series are classified in two ways: (1) market
 groups, and (2) industry groups.  Market groups consist of products
 and materials.  Total products are the aggregate of final products,
 such as consumer goods and equipment, and nonindustrial supplies
 (which are inputs to nonindustrial sectors).  Materials are inputs in
 the manufacture of products.  Major industry groups include
 three-digit NAICS industries and aggregates of these industries-for
 example, durable and nondurable manufacturing, mining, and utilities.
 A complete description of the market and industry structures,
 including details regarding series classification, relative importance
 weights, and data sources, is available on the Board's website at 
 www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/About.htm.
  
 Source Data. On a monthly basis, the individual indexes of industrial
 production are constructed from two main types of source data: (1) output
 measured in physical units and (2) data on inputs to the production
 process, from which output is inferred.  Data on physical products, such as
 tons of steel or barrels of oil, are typically obtained from private trade associations
 and from government agencies; data of this type are used to estimate
 monthly IP wherever possible and appropriate.  Production indexes for a
 few industries are derived by dividing estimated nominal output
 (calculated using unit production and unit values or sales) by a
 corresponding Fisher price index; the most notable of these fall within the
 high-technology grouping and include semiconductors.  When suitable data on physical
 product are not available, estimates of output are based on production-worker
 hours by industry.  Data on hours worked by production workers are
 collected in the monthly establishment survey conducted by the Bureau of
 Labor Statistics.  The factors used to convert inputs into estimates of
 production are based on historical relationships between the inputs and the
 comprehensive annual data used to benchmark the IP indexes; these
 factors also may be influenced by technological or cyclical developments.
 The annual data used in benchmarking the individual IP indexes are
 constructed from a variety of source data, such as the quinquennial
 Censuses of Manufactures and Mineral Industries and the Annual Survey
 of Manufactures, prepared by the Bureau of the Census; the Minerals
 Yearbook, prepared by the U.S. Geological Survey of the
 Department of the Interior; and publications of the Department of Energy.
  
 Aggregation Methodology and Weights.  The aggregation method for
 the IP index is a version of the Fisher-ideal index formula.  (For a detailed
 discussion of the aggregation method, see the Federal Reserve Bulletin
 February 1997 and March 2001.)  In the IP index, series that measure the
 output of an individual industry are combined using weights derived from
 their proportion in the total value-added output of all industries.  The IP
 index, which extends back to 1919, is built as a chain-type index since
 1972.  The current formula for the growth in monthly IP (or any of the
 sub-aggregates) since 1972 is the geometric mean of the change in output
 (I), and, as can be seen below, is computed using the unit value added
 estimate for the current month (p_m) and the estimate for previous month:
 
 %     Equation not available in ascii file. 
  
 The IP proportions (typically shown in the first column of the relevant
 tables in the monthly G.17 release) are estimates of the industries' relative
 contributions to overall growth in the following year.  For example, the
 relative importance weight of the motor vehicles and parts industry is
 about 6 percent.  If output in this industry increased 10 percent in a month,
 then this gain would boost growth in total IP by 6/10 percentage point
 (0.06 x 10% = 0.6%).  To assist users with calculations, the Federal
 Reserve's website provides supplemental monthly statistics that represent
 the exact proportionate contribution of a monthly change in a component
 index to the monthly change in the total index (www.federalreserve.gov/
 releases/G17/ipdisk/ipweightssa.txt).
 
 Timing. The first estimate of output for a month is published
 around the 15th of the following month. The estimate is preliminary
 (denoted by the superscript "p" in tables) and subject to revision
 in each of the subsequent five months as new source data become
 available. (Revised estimates are denoted by the superscript "r" in
 tables.)  For the first estimate of output for a given month, about 74
 percent of the source data (in value-added terms) are available; the
 fraction of available source data increases to 85 percent for 
 estimates in the second month that the estimate is published, 95
 percent in the third month, 96 percent in the fourth month, 97 percent
 in the fifth month, and 97 percent in the sixth month. Data
 availability by data type in early 2017 is summarized in the table
 below:

 The physical product group includes series based on either monthly or
 quarterly data.  As can be seen in the first row of the table, in the
 first month, a physical product indicator is available for more than one-half
 of the series (in terms of value added) that ultimately are based on
 physical product data (32 percent out of a total of 56 percent).  Of
 the 27 percent, about four-fifths (25 percent of total IP) include
 series that are derived from weekly physical product data and for
 which actual monthly data may lag up to several months.  On average,
 quarterly product data are received for the fourth estimate of
 industrial production.  Specifically, quarterly data are available for
 the third estimate of the last month of a quarter, the fourth estimate
 of the second month of a quarter, and the fifth estimate of the first
 month of a quarter.
 
 Seasonal Adjustment. Individual series are seasonally adjusted
 using Census X-13 ARIMA. For series based on production-worker hours,
 the current seasonal factors were estimated with data through January 2018;
 for other series, the factors were estimated with data through
 at least December 2017.  Series are pre-adjusted for the effects of
 holidays or the business cycle when appropriate.  For the data since
 1972, all seasonally adjusted aggregate indexes are calculated by
 aggregating the seasonally adjusted indexes of the individual series.
 Additional documentation and X-13 specifications can be found on the Board's
 website at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/About.htm.
 
 Reliability.  The average revision to the level of the
 total IP index, without regard to sign, between the first and the
 fourth estimates was 0.27 percent during the 1987-2017 period.  The
 average revision to the percent change in total IP, without
 regard to sign, from the first to the fourth estimates was 0.22
 percentage point during the 1987-2017 period.  In most cases (about
 85 percent), the direction of the change in output indicated by the
 first estimate for a given month is the same as that shown by the
 fourth estimate.
 
 Rounding.  The published percent changes are calculated from
 unrounded indexes, and may not be the same as percent changes
 calculated from the rounded indexes shown in the release.
 
 Capacity Utilization
 
 Overview.  The Federal Reserve Board constructs estimates of
 capacity and capacity utilization for industries in manufacturing,
 mining, and electric and gas utilities.  For a given industry, the
 capacity utilization rate is equal to an output index (seasonally
 adjusted) divided by a capacity index.  The Federal Reserve Board's
 capacity indexes attempt to capture the concept of sustainable
   maximum output-the greatest level of output a plant can maintain
 within the framework of a realistic work schedule, after factoring in
 normal downtime and assuming sufficient availability of inputs to
 operate the capital in place.
 
 Coverage.  Capacity indexes are constructed for 89 detailed
 industries (71 in manufacturing, 16 in mining, and 2 in utilities),
 which mostly correspond to industries at the three- and four-digit
 North American Industry Classification System, or NAICS, level.
 Estimates of capacity and utilization are available for a variety of groups, 
 including durable and nondurable manufacturing, total manufacturing, 
 mining, utilities, and total industry.  Manufacturing consists of those 
 industries included in the NAICS definition of manufacturing plus 
 those industries-logging and newspaper, periodical, book, and directory
 publishing-that have traditionally been considered to be manufacturing
 and included in the industrial sector.  Also, special aggregates are available,
 such as high-technology industries and manufacturing excluding high-technology industries.
 
 Source Data.  The monthly rates of capacity utilization are
 designed to be consistent with both the monthly data on production and
 the periodically available data on capacity and utilization.  Because
 there is no direct monthly information on overall industrial capacity
 or utilization rates, the Federal Reserve first estimates annual
 capacity indexes from the source data.  Capacity data reported in
 physical units from government sources (primarily from the
 U.S. Geological Survey and the Department of Energy's Energy
 Information Administration) and trade sources are available for
 portions of several industries in manufacturing (for example, paper,
 industrial chemicals, petroleum refining, motor vehicles), as well as
 for electric utilities and mining; these industries represent about 27
 percent of total industrial capacity.  When physical product data are
 unavailable for manufacturing industries, capacity indexes are based
 on responses to the Bureau of the Census's Quarterly Survey of
   Plant Capacity (QSPC); these industries account for about
 64 percent of total industry capacity.  In the absence of utilization
 data for a few mining and petroleum series, capacity is based on
 trends through peaks in production (roughly 9 percent of total
 industry capacity).  A detailed description of the methodology used to
 construct the capacity indexes is available on the Board's website
 (www.federalreserve.gov/releases/G17/Meth/MethCap.htm).
 
 Aggregation Methodology.  Monthly capacity aggregates are
 calculated in three steps: (1) utilization aggregates are calculated
 on an annual basis through the most recent full year as
 capacity-weighted aggregates of individual utilization rates; (2) the
 annual aggregate capacity is derived from the corresponding production
 and utilization aggregates; (3) the monthly capacity aggregate is
 obtained by interpolating with a Fisher index of its constituent monthly
 capacity series.  Utilization rates for the individual series and aggregates
 are calculated by dividing the pertinent monthly production index by the
 related capacity index.
 
 Consistency.  A major aim is that the Federal Reserve
 utilization rates be consistent over time so that, for example, a rate
 of 85 percent means about the same degree of tightness that it meant
 in the past.  A major task for the Federal Reserve in developing
 reasonable and consistent time series of capacity and utilization is
 dealing with inconsistencies between the movements of the industrial
 production index and the survey-based utilization rates.  The
 McGraw-Hill/DRI Survey, now discontinued, was the primary source of
 manufacturing utilization rates for many years.  This survey of
 large companies reported, on average, higher utilization rates
 than those reported by establishments covered by the
 annual Survey of Plant Capacity (the primary source of factory
 operating rates through 2006, after which it was discontinued) 
 for the fourteen years they overlapped.  Adjustments have been made to 
 keep the industry utilization rates currently reported by the Federal
 Reserve (now based on the QSPC) roughly in line with rates formerly
 reported by McGraw-Hill.  As a consequence, the rates reported by the
 Federal Reserve tend to be higher than the rates reported in the
 Census utilization surveys.
 
 Perspective.  Over the 1972-2017 period, the average total
 industry utilization rate was 79.8 percent; for manufacturing, the
 average factory operating rate was 78.3 percent.  Industrial
 plants usually operate at capacity utilization rates that are well
 below 100 percent: none of the broad aggregates has ever reached 100
 percent.  For total manufacturing, utilization rates have exceeded 
 90 percent only in wartime.  The highs and lows in capacity utilization 
 are specific to each series and do not all occur in the same month.
